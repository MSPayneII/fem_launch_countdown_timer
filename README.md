## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users are able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second

## Ensuring countdown is always active

To ensure the countdown timer always displays an active countdown, I've set up the code so the launch deadline will always be 9 days away from the day/time the countdown timer website is opened.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow
